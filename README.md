# arcpy-scripts
Arcpy scripts for creating and updating mosaic datasets and geospatial services in the context of
the [FP7 ERMES project](http://www.ermes-fp7space.eu/).

The folder **2015** contains scripts and configuration amd logs files used to set up and update on a regular basis mosaic
datasets and the corresponding Images services for the 2015 crop season.

The folder **2016** contains the files and scripts for the 2016 crop season. Compared to those of 2015,
such scripts have been revised and optimised to gain in performance. Scripts are much better documented.
There also are some new scripts, which automate some manual tasks done during the past season. The overall aim is to
gradually reduce the burden to set up the required files and services for a new crop season.
